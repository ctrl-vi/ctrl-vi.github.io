# Violet Monserate's Personal Website

It's finally time for me to make a per  sonal website!

This will primarily be a place to consolidate my contact information, class projects, and perhaps host my thoughts!

Secondarily, it'll act as a little practice for using web dev frameworks. I chose **Astro** because:

- It seemed really easy to use
- It supports MPA (Multi Page Application), which should help with performance, SEO, and sending specific parts of the website to certain folks!
- I haven't used it before!

It's all about expanding my horizons and seeing what I like!
